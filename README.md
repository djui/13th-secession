I did a quick and sloppy vector redraw of the
[13th Secession exhibition poster](http://hogd.pbworks.com/w/page/18698635/Koloman%20Moser%20poster%20for%20the%2013th%20Vienna%20Secession%20exhibition)
by [Koloman Moser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koloman_Moser) without the lower textual
part. There, the font would be something like
[Kolo Family](http://www.linotype.com/410225/kolo-family.html).
